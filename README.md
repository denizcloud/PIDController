# PIDController
A mediocre PID Controller Object that is written in Java in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
The main file of the project is just for testing, it can be removed or added a new main class.
Feel free to change/distrubute/use the PIDController however you like.
The original limits of the PID are between -1 and 1 and can be changed or can be made to have no limits.
